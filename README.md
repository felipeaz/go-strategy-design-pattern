Strategy pattern implementation in Golang

## Strategy Design Pattern
Strategy is a behavioral pattern that isolates everything that change
into a separated class, making them interchangeable.

## Project
This project simulates an RPG scenario where each character has a class and a weapon

Each class has its own power and Each weapon have their own attack. Those particularities
have been isolated into separated class and only the methods used are known by the character.
